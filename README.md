## About

BattleBlaster is a *Topdown Shooter* prototype focused on core gameplay mechanics and interactivity.
It was developed as a study project in Unreal Engine using C++ programming, with emphasis on building modular systems and learning the engine through hands-on gameplay logic.

## Features

*🔫 Shooting system with visual hit feedback (impacts & particles)
*🛡️ Health & damage system fully implemented in C++
*🎮 Tank-style movement controller (rotation & forward drive)

*Tank-style controls (rotation and movement)
*Shooting system with feedback effects
*Turrets as destructible enemies
*Stage progression through turret destruction
